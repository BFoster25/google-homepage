The Odin Project: Google Homepage


Introduction
For this mini-project, you’ll deconstruct an existing web page and rebuild it. Don’t worry if the links don’t go anywhere and the search box doesn’t do anything when you submit it. The goal is to start thinking about how elements get placed on the page and roughly how they get styled and aligned. For some of you, this may be the first time you’ve actually tried to “build” something in HTML (very exciting!).

Using the browser’s developer tools (right-clicking something on the page and clicking “inspect element” will get you there) will be your best friend. Build the page in a .html text file and open it in your browser to check it out.

Try These Before Starting
These skills will be helpful for you when you start building. Either try them yourself or at least make sure you know how to do it:

Two ways to move a div around on the page
Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
Identify the background color of an existing webpage
Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
Center an element horizontally
Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
Build a very basic form (even if it doesn’t “go” anywhere)
Setting Up Your Project’s GitHub Repository (optional)
As mentioned in the introduction to Git, you’ll want to organize all your projects like a portfolio and link them to GitHub so it can be seen by others.

If you do not know how to set up a repository, follow the instructions found in Project: Git Basics to learn how.

If you haven’t already, create a folder on your computer called the_odin_project and cd into it. This folder will house all the projects you do at Odin.
Create a new repo for this project on GitHub.com and call it google-homepage (instead of git-test).
Then move that repository onto your local machine. The command should look like: git clone git@github.com:username/google-homepage.git (use SSH).

Setting up SSH on GitHub.
Now cd into the google-homepage project directory that is now on your local machine; set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction for what the current project is and what skills you have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
If you are having trouble:

Ensure you followed the steps here on Step 2.3 to clone from GitHub with SSH.
Refer to the cheat sheet in the Git Basics Lesson.
Review the workflow in the Git Basics Project.
Note: All Git commands need to be run from inside your project’s folder (did you forget to cd into the google-homepage folder?)

When you’re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main.

When writing code, it’s considered best practice to commit early and often. Commit every time you have a meaningful change in the code. This will create a timeline of your progress and show that your finished code didn’t appear out of nowhere.

If you have entered git push origin main and typed out your username and password, if you refresh your GitHub page, you should see new files added onto GitHub.

Okay, that’s enough Git for the moment – time to actually build stuff!

Warning About Looking at Other People’s Finished Project Code Before You have Completed Your Own
All of our projects have a “Student Solutions” section at the bottom for people to post their completed code and live websites for the projects. These are here for you to compare your completed code to and see what other routes people have chosen to take with their project code and designs.

We know it may be tempting to look at the solutions when you get stuck or don’t know where to start, but don’t do it! Here are some reasons why:

All of the submitted projects are other student solutions. This means they are written by other people who are also still learning and may not necessarily be representative of “best practice” or quality code.
Looking at solutions robs you of the chance to develop your problem solving and researching skills. In the real world, there will not always be “solutions” for you to look at and you will have to come up with your own.
There are many different ways to achieve the same end result, it is not “one size fits all”.
An Analogy: “Looking at completed code is like learning how to make pizza dough from looking at a baked pizza.” There is a lot more that goes into it than you would have assumed by only seeing the final product and not the process that lead to it.
Once you have completed your project feel free to look at the other solutions to see alternative ways the project was completed.

Note: It is okay to check the “Live Preview” to get an idea of layout and styling before starting but not the code files.

Assignment
Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage
(the simple one with just a search box).

Inside your project folder, create your index.html file

Tips:
DON’T BE A PERFECTIONIST! You’re just trying to make it look like google.com, not actually function like it and it doesn’t have to be spaced exactly the same way to the pixel. Any dropdown menus or form submissions or hover-highlighting should be ignored.
USE GOOGLE! You’ll probably run into roadblocks where you can’t figure out how to do something so do what all good devs do… Google it!
Now is a good time to set up the live server extension in VSCode, if you haven’t already. This extension will save you from the hassle of refreshing the browser window repeatedly to see changes made in your code and will automatically load the most recent change in the browser window.
If you’re frustrated with trying to get buttons or inputs to style the way you want (for instance, they seem to just not respond to any styles), look into the CSS property -webkit-appearance: none; or -moz-appearance if you’re using Firefox.
Here’s a link to the Google Logo just in case they temporarily replace it with a Doodle!
Here’s a cached page of the Google home page for reference in case the original logo is not there.
Here’s a link to the Google Material Icons page. This is a great resource for free to use open source icons.
Start with just putting the main elements on the page (the logo image and search form), then get them placed horizontally. You can either download the Google logo or link directly to its URL on the web in your <img> tag.
Next do the navbar across the top, first building the content and then trying to position it. Check out how to build a horizontal CSS navbar if you’re lost.
Finally, put in the footer, which should be very similar to the top navbar.
In general, do as much on your own as you can before relying on the developer tools (or viewing the page’s source code) to help you along.
Push your project to GitHub using the instructions above! Then consider sharing your project with the community by submitting a link to your repository in the Solutions section below.

Notes from Brandon:

This project is incomplete, I may return to it in the future. For now, I want to just upload this to GitHub for practice.
